```

### Manual Testing
- Use Postman collection for API endpoint testing
- Browser developer tools for frontend validation
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox)

## 📊 Database Schema

### Main Tables
- **sensors**: Sensor location and configuration data
- **sensor_data**: Historical AQI measurements
- **users**: User accounts and role assignments
- **alerts**: System-generated alerts for threshold violations

## 🎯 Usage

### For Public Users
1. Navigate to the public map interface
2. View real-time AQI data through color-coded markers
3. Click markers to see detailed AQI information and historical charts

### For Monitoring Admins
1. Log in through the admin panel
2. Manage sensors (create, edit, deactivate)
3. Monitor real-time AQI data and alerts
4. Configure alert thresholds
5. Upload CSV data for bulk sensor management

### For System Admins
1. Access full system diagnostics
2. Manage user accounts and permissions
3. View system configuration and health metrics
4. Monitor application performance

## 🚨 AQI Alert System

The system automatically generates alerts based on standard AQI categories:
- **Good (0-50)**: Green markers
- **Moderate (51-100)**: Yellow markers
- **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101-150)**: Orange markers
- **Unhealthy (151-200)**: Red markers
- **Very Unhealthy (201-300)**: Purple markers
- **Hazardous (301+)**: Maroon markers

Alerts are triggered when AQI levels exceed 200 (Unhealthy threshold).

## 🔧 Configuration

### AQI Simulation
Configure simulation parameters in the admin dashboard:
- Data generation intervals (default: 5 minutes)
- AQI value ranges and patterns
- Peak hour variations

### Alert Thresholds
Customize alert triggers through the configuration panel:
- Set custom AQI thresholds
- Configure notification preferences
- Manage alert recipients

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and tested across:
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Tablet devices
- Mobile phones
